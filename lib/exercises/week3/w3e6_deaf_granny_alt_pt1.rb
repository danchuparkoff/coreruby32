  Exercise 6. Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should
    respond with HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear
    you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938! To make your program really believable,
    have grandma shout a different year each time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950.
    You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.

    Adapted from Chris Pine's Book.

    For example:
      You enter: Hello Grandma
      Grandma responds: HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
      You enter: HELLO GRANDMA
      Grandma responds: NO, NOT SINCE 1938!
